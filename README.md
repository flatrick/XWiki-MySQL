# XWiki-setup

Guides to setup XWiki, first the guides will focus on using MySQL as database, Tomcat as servlet-container, OpenJDK-8 for Java-runtime and nginx as a reverse proxy that also handles setting sane cache-values for the visitors

## INTRO

1. The first goal of this project is to create a guide for how to setup XWiki on Ubuntu 18.04 using Tomcat, OpenJDK, MySQL and with nginx as a reverse-proxy in a easy to maintain manner.
1. The second goal is to add how to do it on FreeBSD/FreeNAS.
1. And the third is to try and make a script that can do all of this automatically, as long as there is a "recipe" for the chosen OS.
